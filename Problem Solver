# 🧠 Math Problem Solver – Forked and Documented by Sania Irshad

## 📌 Introduction

This repository is a **fork of the original project by [Shumaila](https://github.com/shumaila1823)**.  
It is a Python-based math problem solver capable of handling **algebraic**, **calculus**, and **matrix-based** operations using SymPy and NumPy libraries.

This fork includes the original logic, along with a structured `README.md`, better formatting, and documentation for academic and learning purposes.

## 🔧 System Components

- **Input Module**: Takes user input for type of problem and values
- **Processing Module**: Solves equations using symbolic and numerical techniques
- **Output Module**: Displays final results

📁 Module Structure:
- `algebra/`: Linear and quadratic equations  
- `calculus/`: Derivatives  
- `linear_algebra/`: Matrix operations

## 🧱 Class/Function Design

```
MathSolver
├── AlgebraSolver
│   ├── solve_linear(a, b)
│   └── solve_quadratic(a, b, c)
├── CalculusSolver
│   └── find_derivative(expr)
└── MatrixSolver
    ├── matrix_addition(A, B)
    ├── matrix_multiplication(A, B)
    └── matrix_determinant(A)
```

(Uses functions for simplicity; can be upgraded to full OOP.)
